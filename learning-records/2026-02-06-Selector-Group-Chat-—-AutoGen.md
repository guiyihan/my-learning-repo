Selector Group Chat
Selector Group Chat
SelectorGroupChat implements a team where participants take turns broadcasting messages to all other members. A generative model (e.g., an LLM) selects the next speaker based on the shared context, enabling dynamic, context-aware collaboration.

Key features include:

Model-based speaker selection

Configurable participant roles and descriptions

Prevention of consecutive turns by the same speaker (optional)

Customizable selection prompting

Customizable selection function to override the default model-based selection

Customizable candidate function to narrow-down the set of agents for selection using model

Note

SelectorGroupChat is a high-level API. For more control and customization, refer to the Group Chat Pattern in the Core API documentation to implement your own group chat logic.

How Does it Work?
SelectorGroupChat is a group chat similar to RoundRobinGroupChat, but with a model-based next speaker selection mechanism. When the team receives a task through run() or run_stream(), the following steps are executed:

The team analyzes the current conversation context, including the conversation history and participants’ name and description attributes, to determine the next speaker using a model. By default, the team will not select the same speak consecutively unless it is the only agent available. This can be changed by setting allow_repeated_speaker=True. You can also override the model by providing a custom selection function.

The team prompts the selected speaker agent to provide a response, which is then broadcasted to all other participants.

The termination condition is checked to determine if the conversation should end, if not, the process repeats from step 1.

When the conversation ends, the team returns the TaskResult containing the conversation history from this task.

Once the team finishes the task, the conversation context is kept within the team and all participants, so the next task can continue from the previous conversation context. You can reset the conversation context by calling reset().

In this section, we will demonstrate how to use SelectorGroupChat with a simple example for a web search and data analysis task.

Example: Web Search/Analysis
from typing import List, Sequence

from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen_agentchat.conditions import MaxMessageTermination, TextMentionTermination

Agents


This system uses three specialized agents:

Planning Agent: The strategic coordinator that breaks down complex tasks into manageable subtasks.

Web Search Agent: An information retrieval specialist that interfaces with the search_web_tool.

Data Analyst Agent: An agent specialist in performing calculations equipped with percentage_change_tool.

The tools search_web_tool and percentage_change_tool are external tools that the agents can use to perform their tasks.

# Note: This example uses mock tools instead of real APIs for demonstration purposes
def search_web_tool(query: str) -> str:
    if "2006-2007" in query:
        return """Here are the total points scored by Miami Heat players in the 2006-2007 season:
        Udonis Haslem: 844 points
        Dwayne Wade: 1397 points
        James Posey: 550 points
        ...
        """
    elif "2007-2008" in query:
        return "The number of total rebounds for Dwayne Wade in the Miami Heat season 2007-2008 is 214."
    elif "2008-2009" in query:
        return "The number of total rebounds for Dwayne Wade in the Miami Heat season 2008-2009 is 398."
    return "No data found."


def percentage_change_tool(start: float, end: float) -> float:
    return ((end - start) / start) * 100
Let’s create the specialized agents using the AssistantAgent class. It is important to note that the agents’ name and description attributes are used by the model to determine the next speaker, so it is recommended to provide meaningful names and descriptions.

model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model="gpt-4o")

planning_agent = AssistantAgent(
    "PlanningAgent",
    description="An agent for planning tasks, this agent should be the first to engage when given a new task.",
    model_client=model_client,
    system_message="""
    You are a planning agent.
    Your job is to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.
    Your team members are:
        WebSearchAgent: Searches for information
        DataAnalystAgent: Performs calculations

    You only plan and delegate tasks - you do not execute them yourself.

    When assigning tasks, use this format:
    1. <agent> : <task>

    After all tasks are complete, summarize the findings and end with "TERMINATE".
    """,
)

web_search_agent = AssistantAgent(
    "WebSearchAgent",
    description="An agent for searching information on the web.",
    tools=[search_web_tool],
    model_client=model_client,
    system_message="""
    You are a web search agent.
    Your only tool is search_tool - use it to find information.
    You make only one search call at a time.
    Once you have the results, you never do calculations based on them.
    """,
)

data_analyst_agent = AssistantAgent(
    "DataAnalystAgent",
    description="An agent for performing calculations.",
    model_client=model_client,
    tools=[percentage_change_tool],
    system_message="""
    You are a data analyst.
    Given the tasks you have been assigned, you should analyze the data and provide results using the tools provided.
    If you have not seen the data, ask for it.
    """,
)
Note

By default, AssistantAgent returns the tool output as the response. If your tool does not return a well-formed string in natural language format, you may want to add a reflection step within the agent by setting reflect_on_tool_use=True when creating the agent. This will allow the agent to reflect on the tool output and provide a natural language response.

Workflow
The task is received by the SelectorGroupChat which, based on agent descriptions, selects the most appropriate agent to handle the initial task (typically the Planning Agent).

The Planning Agent analyzes the task and breaks it down into subtasks, assigning each to the most appropriate agent using the format: <agent> : <task>

Based on the conversation context and agent descriptions, the SelectorGroupChat manager dynamically selects the next agent to handle their assigned subtask.

The Web Search Agent performs searches one at a time, storing results in the shared conversation history.

The Data Analyst processes the gathered information using available calculation tools when selected.

The workflow continues with agents being dynamically selected until either:

The Planning Agent determines all subtasks are complete and sends “TERMINATE”

An alternative termination condition is met (e.g., a maximum number of messages)

When defining your agents, make sure to include a helpful description since this is used to decide which agent to select next.

Termination Conditions
Let’s use two termination conditions: TextMentionTermination to end the conversation when the Planning Agent sends “TERMINATE”, and MaxMessageTermination to limit the conversation to 25 messages to avoid infinite loop.

text_mention_termination = TextMentionTermination("TERMINATE")
max_messages_termination = MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=25)
termination = text_mention_termination | max_messages_termination
Selector Prompt
SelectorGroupChat uses a model to select the next speaker based on the conversation context. We will use a custom selector prompt to properly align with the workflow.

selector_prompt = """Select an agent to perform task.

{roles}

Current conversation context:
{history}

Read the above conversation, then select an agent from {participants} to perform the next task.
Make sure the planner agent has assigned tasks before other agents start working.
Only select one agent.
"""
The string variables available in the selector prompt are:

{participants}: The names of candidates for selection. The format is ["<name1>", "<name2>", ...].

{roles}: A newline-separated list of names and descriptions of the candidate agents. The format for each line is: "<name> : <description>".

{history}: The conversation history formatted as a double newline separated of names and message content. The format for each message is: "<name> : <message content>".

Tip

Try not to overload the model with too much instruction in the selector prompt.

What is too much? It depends on the capabilities of the model you are using. For GPT-4o and equivalents, you can use a selector prompt with a condition for when each speaker should be selected. For smaller models such as Phi-4, you should keep the selector prompt as simple as possible such as the one used in this example.

Generally, if you find yourself writing multiple conditions for each agent, it is a sign that you should consider using a custom selection function, or breaking down the task into smaller, sequential tasks to be handled by separate agents or teams.

Running the Team
Let’s create the team with the agents, termination conditions, and custom selector prompt.

team = SelectorGroupChat(
    [planning_agent, web_search_agent, data_analyst_agent],
    model_client=model_client,
    termination_condition=termination,
    selector_prompt=selector_prompt,
    allow_repeated_speaker=True,  # Allow an agent to speak multiple turns in a row.
)
Now we run the team with a task to find information about an NBA player.

task = "Who was the Miami Heat player with the highest points in the 2006-2007 season, and what was the percentage change in his total rebounds between the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons?"
# Use asyncio.run(...) if you are running this in a script.
await Console(team.run_stream(task=task))

---------- PlanningAgent ----------
To complete this task, we need to perform the following subtasks:

1. Find out which Miami Heat player had the highest points in the 2006-2007 season.
2. Gather data on this player's total rebounds for the 2007-2008 season.
3. Gather data on this player's total rebounds for the 2008-2009 season.
4. Calculate the percentage change in the player's total rebounds between the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons.

I'll assign these tasks accordingly:

1. WebSearchAgent: Search for the Miami Heat player with the highest points in the 2006-2007 NBA season.
2. WebSearchAgent: Find the total rebounds for this player in the 2007-2008 NBA season.
3. WebSearchAgent: Find the total rebounds for this player in the 2008-2009 NBA season.
4. DataAnalystAgent: Calculate the percentage change in total rebounds from the 2007-2008 season to the 2008-2009 season for this player.

As we can see, after the Web Search Agent conducts the necessary searches and the Data Analyst Agent completes the necessary calculations, we find that Dwayne Wade was the Miami Heat player with the highest points in the 2006-2007 season, and the percentage change in his total rebounds between the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons is 85.98%!

Custom Selector Function
Often times we want better control over the selection process. To this end, we can set the selector_func argument with a custom selector function to override the default model-based selection. This allows us to implement more complex selection logic and state-based transitions.

For instance, we want the Planning Agent to speak immediately after any specialized agent to check the progress.

Note

Returning None from the custom selector function will use the default model-based selection.

Note

Custom selector functions are not serialized when .dump_component() is called on the SelectorGroupChat team . If you need to serialize team configurations with custom selector functions, consider implementing custom workflows and serialization logic.

def selector_func(messages: Sequence[BaseAgentEvent | BaseChatMessage]) -> str | None:
    if messages[-1].source != planning_agent.name:
        return planning_agent.name
    return None


# Reset the previous team and run the chat again with the selector function.

You can see from the conversation log that the Planning Agent always speaks immediately after the specialized agents.

Tip

Each participant agent only makes one step (executing tools, generating a response, etc.) on each turn. If you want an AssistantAgent to repeat until it stop returning a ToolCallSummaryMessage when it has finished running all the tools it needs to run, you can do so by checking the last message and returning the agent if it is a ToolCallSummaryMessage.

Custom Candidate Function
One more possible requirement might be to automatically select the next speaker from a filtered list of agents. For this, we can set candidate_func parameter with a custom candidate function to filter down the list of potential agents for speaker selection for each turn of groupchat.

This allow us to restrict speaker selection to a specific set of agents after a given agent.

Note

The candidate_func is only valid if selector_func is not set. Returning None or an empty list [] from the custom candidate function will raise a ValueError.

Who was the Miami Heat player with the highest points in the 2006-2007 season, and what was the percentage change in his total rebounds between the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons?
---------- PlanningAgent ----------
To answer this question, we'll break it down into two main subtasks:

1. Identify the Miami Heat player with the highest points in the 2006-2007 season.
2. Calculate the percentage change in that player's total rebounds between the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons.

Let's assign these tasks:

1. WebSearchAgent: Search for the Miami Heat player with the highest points in the 2006-2007 NBA season.
2. WebSearchAgent: Find the total rebound statistics for that identified player for both the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 NBA seasons.
3. DataAnalystAgent: Calculate the percentage change in the player's total rebounds between the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons once the data is retrieved.

You can see from the conversation log that the Planning Agent returns to conversation once the Web Search Agent and Data Analyst Agent took their turns and it finds that the task was not finished as expected so it called the WebSearchAgent again to get rebound values and then called DataAnalysetAgent to get the percentage change.

User Feedback
We can add UserProxyAgent to the team to provide user feedback during a run. See Human-in-the-Loop for more details about UserProxyAgent.

To use the UserProxyAgent in the web search example, we simply add it to the team and update the selector function to always check for user feedback after the planning agent speaks. If the user responds with "APPROVE", the conversation continues, otherwise, the planning agent tries again, until the user approves.

user_proxy_agent = UserProxyAgent("UserProxyAgent", description="A proxy for the user to approve or disapprove tasks.")


def selector_func_with_user_proxy(messages: Sequence[BaseAgentEvent | BaseChatMessage]) -> str | None:

Using Reasoning Models
So far in the examples, we have used a gpt-4o model. Models like gpt-4o and gemini-1.5-flash are great at following instructions, so you can have relatively detailed instructions in the selector prompt for the team and the system messages for each agent to guide their behavior.

However, if you are using a reasoning model like o3-mini, you will need to keep the selector prompt and system messages as simple and to the point as possible. This is because the reasoning models are already good at coming up with their own instructions given the context provided to them.

This also means that we don’t need a planning agent to break down the task anymore, since the SelectorGroupChat that uses a reasoning model can do that on its own.

In the following example, we will use o3-mini as the model for the agents and the team, and we will not use a planning agent. Also, we are keeping the selector prompt and system messages as simple as possible.

model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model="o3-mini")

## AI总结

# Selector Group Chat 总结

## 核心概念

• **SelectorGroupChat** 是一个团队模式，参与者轮流向所有成员广播消息
• 使用生成模型（如LLM）根据共享上下文选择下一个发言者
• 支持动态、上下文感知的协作

## 主要特性

• 基于模型的发言者选择机制
• 可配置参与者角色和描述
• 可选择防止同一发言者连续发言
• 可自定义选择提示词
• 可自定义选择函数覆盖默认模型选择
• 可自定义候选函数缩小选择范围

## 工作流程

• **步骤1**：团队分析当前对话上下文（包括历史记录和参与者的名称、描述属性），使用模型确定下一个发言者
• **步骤2**：团队提示选定的代理提供响应，然后广播给所有参与者
• **步骤3**：检查终止条件，如果未结束则重复步骤1
• **步骤4**：对话结束时，返回包含任务对话历史的TaskResult

## 示例应用：网络搜索/数据分析

### 三个专业代理

• **Planning Agent（规划代理）**：战略协调者，将复杂任务分解为可管理的子任务
• **Web Search Agent（网络搜索代理）**：信息检索专家，使用search_web_tool工具
• **Data Analyst Agent（数据分析代理）**：计算专家，配备percentage_change_tool工具

### 终止条件

• **TextMentionTermination**：当规划代理发送"TERMINATE"时结束对话
• **MaxMessageTermination**：限制对话最多25条消息以避免无限循环

### 选择器提示词变量

• `{participants}`：候选代理的名称列表
• `{roles}`：候选代理的名称和描述
• `{history}`：格式化的对话历史记录

## 高级功能

### 自定义选择函数（selector_func）

• 可实现更复杂的选择逻辑和基于状态的转换
• 返回None时使用默认的基于模型的选择
• 注意：自定义选择函数不会在序列化时保存

### 自定义候选函数（candidate_func）

• 用于自动从过滤后的代理列表中选择下一个发言者
• 仅在未设置selector_func时有效
• 返回None或空列表会引发ValueError

### 用户反馈集成

• 可添加**UserProxyAgent**实现人机交互
• 用户可在运行期间批准或拒绝任务
• 通过自定义选择函数检查用户反馈（如"APPROVE"）

## 使用推理模型（如o3-mini）

• 推理模型擅长根据上下文生成指令
• 需要简化选择器提示词和系统消息
• 不需要规划代理，因为SelectorGroupChat本身可以分解任务
• 保持提示词简单明了，避免过多详细指令

## 最佳实践提示

• 为代理提供有意义的名称和描述，因为这些用于确定下一个发言者
• 避免在选择器提示词中加入过多指令
• 如果发现需要为每个代理编写多个条件，考虑使用自定义选择函数或将任务分解为更小的顺序任务
• 对于GPT-4o等模型可使用较详细的指令，对于小型模型（如Phi-4）应保持提示词简单
