Quickstart

Copy page

This quickstart takes you from a simple setup to a fully functional AI agent in just a few minutes.
LangChain Docs MCP server
If you’re using an AI coding assistant or IDE (e.g. Claude Code or Cursor), you should install the LangChain Docs MCP server to get the most out of it. This ensures your agent has access to up-to-date LangChain documentation and examples.
​
Requirements
For these examples, you will need to:
Install the LangChain package
Set up a Claude (Anthropic) account and get an API key
Set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable in your terminal
Although these examples use Claude, you can use any supported model by changing the model name in the code and setting up the appropriate API key.
​
Build a basic agent
Start by creating a simple agent that can answer questions and call tools. The agent will use Claude Sonnet 4.5 as its language model
